    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Wes";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "Wesley";
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array? ** If you update an array it will always reference back to the original array

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //if you pass nothing into slice, it will take an actual copy of the array

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //spread takes every item out of your iterable, and puts it into the containing array
    team4[3] = 'Winnie!';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // first argument is a blank object {}, second argument is where we fold in all of the properties and values from the 'person' object, then third argument is where we add in our own properties/values
    // Object.assign only works for one level deep!
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 101});
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
